If I get more time to complete this coding assessment, I would like to
•	Implement room database for data storage
•	Implement DataSource class which is solely responsible for getting data from server and send it to Repo class. Repo class is resposible for checking the data coming from data source and update the database and also send data to viewmodel
•	add more improvements to Ui
•	will add unit and instrumented tests
